cf-test-space Resource
======================

This resource helps with setting up a temporary test-space
on cloudfoundry, suitable for running integration tests.

Getting the resource creates the test-space with a randomly generated name
and putting it destroys it.

Source Configuration
--------------------

- `api_uri`: *Required*. The api_uri of a CF installation. E.g. for 
            PWS you would use https://api.run.pivotal.io
- `user`: *Required*. User-id, used to login to cf.
- `password`: *Required*. Password for the user.
- `org`: *Required*. Name of org under which to create the test space.

Behavior:
---------

### check: generate random test-space name

A random name for the test space is created. This random name is
treated as the version id. The space itself is not created yet.

### in: Create the test space

the cf cli is used to login to cf, then a test-space with 
the specified name (random name generated by 'check') is created.

If succesful, a `config.json` file is placed into the target folder with 
contents like the following:

```
{
    "api_url": "https://api.run.pivotal.io",
    "org": "some-org-for-testing",
    "space": "the-random-space-name",
    "user": "someone@pivotal.io",
    "password": "secret"
}
```

### out: Delete the test space

An attempt is made to delete the test-space.
